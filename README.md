# AWS crud-lambda's built by github pipeline

Revived my github account to get experience with aws, github workflows and the rust-sdk the AWS provides (as developer preview).
On pushing this repo a github workflow should build a pipeline that creates a couple of lambda (crud-) functions.

Unlikely that this will work in one go, this got changed to trigger the pipeline
